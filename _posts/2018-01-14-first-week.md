Coming from my job as an implementation consultant at Deloitte Digital and joining Metis has been such a whirlwind, but in the best way possible. 

> At Work:  
> **Me:** Hey dude, can you make the system do this? While youâ€™re at it, can you make this button blue and move it to the left side of the screen?  
> **Developer on my team:** Done. Coffee time?  
  
> At Metis:  
> **Me:** This would be a really cool algorithm to design! I wonder if I can build it to do what I want without it taking 392,749,327,538 years to run!  
> **Also me:** #($&(!@&#@!!!!
  
Currently, the ideas in my head far exceed my technical ability to accomplish them. This is the main reason I came to Metis: to bridge that gap.  
  
I love the creativity of working on open ended questions, and there were about a million things that our group wanted to investigate for our first project. Our goal was to recommend the best MTA stations for a nonprofit street team to conduct marketing activities. It felt like our biggest challenge was to reign ourselves in and select a manageable amount of analysis to conduct given the 1 week timeframe, the messy nature of the data, and our own learning curves.  

That being said, I'm extremely proud of our team's work. I've learned so much already and am extremely motivated to push myself further.
